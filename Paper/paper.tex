\begin{abstract}
In this paper we introduce the notion of \textit{fairness} in power consumption of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This topic has been largely overlooked by the literature, but has a significant impact in the design of WSNs with fixed sensor nodes and resource scarce flexible relay nodes.

We propose an approximation algorithm with the aim to introduce fairness to power consumption in WSNs. While overall power consumption has been studied previously, our algorithm considers fairness of power consumption rates a priority in WSN design. Our algorithm introduces additional, limited resources (i.e. relay nodes) to a fixed network. These resources may be moved to achieve minimal overall power consumption and maximum fairness. Hence, we give a multi-objective optimization algorithm for (1) maximum fairness in power consumption, (2) minimal additional resources and (3) minimal power consumption of WSNs.

Experimental analysis of randomly generated WSNs show that the introduction of a small numbers of relay nodes (as compared to sensor nodes) results in a significant increase in fairness of power consumption. However, as further relay nodes are added, we encounter a diminishing return in the increase of fairness. Hence, we pose the question of optimality considering the trade-off between fairness and relay nodes and give a discussion for the experimental determination of such optimality.

We briefly illustrate our WSN fairness simulation software that utilizes the algorithm and visualizes the process of optimizing a WSN for fairness.
