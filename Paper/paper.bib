annote={Recent research on relay node placement in Wireless Sensor Networks mostly focuses on connectivity establishment. Connectivity is one of the most crucial issue, since most of the actions are taken collaboratively. In addition, sensors are small battery operated devices. Usually after the deployment of wireless sensor networks, it is impossible to access a sensor node and change the battery. Once the battery is depleted the node dies. The most important source of energy consumption in sensor networks is message transmission. The energy required to transmit data is directly proportional to $r^4$ where $r$ is the distance between source and destination.},

The first is a single-tiered node placement strategy in which every node is connected via some path consisting of either sensor nodes or relay nodes.  The length between a sensor node and any other node must be <= r, while the length between two relay nodes can be of distance R, where R is defined as R >= r.  Node placement is achieved using Steiner Tree nodes.

The second strategy discussed is what they call a two-tiered node placement strategy, in which any two nodes of the WSN are fully connected by all relay nodes. That is, between any two sensor nodes in the WSN there exists a path by which every intermediary node is a relay node.},

To eliminate the communication overhead required by centralized scheduling protocols, we further derive a distributed inverse-log protocol that is applicable to networks with a large number of nodes. Focusing on large-scale networks with high total data rates, we analyze the energy consumption of the ILS. Our analysis reveals how its energy gain over traditional time-division multiple access depends on the channel and the data-length variations among different nodes.},

In wireless ad hoc sensor networks, energy use is in many cases the most important constraint since it corresponds directly to operational lifetime. Topology management schemes such as GAF put the redundant nodes for routing to sleep in order to save the energy. The radio range will affect the number of neighbouring nodes, which collaborate to forward data to a base station or sink. In this paper we study a simple linear network and deduce the relationship between optimal radio range and traffic. We find that half of the power can be saved if the radio range is adjusted appropriately compared with the best case where equal radio ranges are used."

abstract = "
In a wireless sensor network (WSN), the unbalanced distribution of communication loads often causes the problem of energy hole, which means the energy of the nodes in the hole region will be exhausted sooner than the nodes in other regions. This is a key factor which affects the lifetime of the networks. In this paper we propose an improved corona model with levels for analyzing sensors with adjustable transmission ranges in a WSN with circular multi-hop deployment (modeled as concentric coronas). Based on the model we consider that the right transmission ranges of sensors in each corona is the decision factor for optimizing the network lifetime after nodes deployment. We prove that searching optimal transmission ranges of sensors among all coronas is a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), which is NP hard. Therefore, we propose a centralized algorithm and a distributed algorithm for assigning the transmission ranges of sensors in each corona for different node distributions. The two algorithms can not only reduce the searching complexity but also obtain results approximated to the optimal solution. Furthermore, the simulation results of our solutions indicate that the network lifetime approximates to that ensured by the optimal under both uniform and non-uniform node distribution."

abstract = "
Scalability and extended lifetime are two critical design goals of any large scale wireless sensor network. A two-tiered network model has been proposed recently for this purpose. This is a cluster-based network model composed of relay and sensor nodes. Relay nodes are placed in the playing field to serve as cluster heads and to form a connected network topology for information dissemination at the higher tier. The relay nodes are capable of aggregating data packets from the sensor nodes in their clusters and transmitting them to the sink node via wireless multi-hop paths. In this paper, we study the relay node placement problem in large scale wireless sensor networks. Our objective is to place the fewest number of relay nodes in the playing field of a sensor network such that (1) each sensor node can communicate with at least one relay node and (2) the network of relay nodes is connected.
However, placement strategies realizing goals (1) and (2) do not provide any fault-tolerance as the network may lose functionality after failure of some of the relay nodes. In order to incorporate fault-tolerance in such a network, we ensure that every sensor node is able to communicate with at least two relay nodes and the induced network topology is 2-connected. This strategy will ensure survivability of the network in the event of single fault, in lieu of higher relay node placement cost. We formulate the relay node placement in wireless sensor networks as two optimization problems: (i) Connected Relay Node Single Cover (CRNSC) problem and (ii) 2-Connected Relay Node Double Cover (2CRNDC) problem. We present two polynomial time approximation algorithms to solve the CRNSC problem. We prove that the ratio of the number of relay nodes needed by the approximation algorithm to the number of relay nodes needed by the optimal algorithm is bounded by 8 for the first algorithm and 4.5 for the second. In addition, for the 2CRNDC problem we provide two approximation algorithms with performance bounds 6 and 4.5, respectively."

abstract={Smart home is getting popular. An essential element of smart home is sensor network to convey environment information to the control station. There have been many communication protocols for this sensor network. One problem of previous protocols is unbalanced energy consumption among sensor nodes. Even though they tried to overcome energy unbalanced consumption, they could not solve this problem satisfactorily yet. In this paper, we find that basic reason for this unbalanced energy consumption is that there is normally one base node. Because of this architectural problem, the nodes around this sink node lose their energy more easily relative to other nodes. So, we propose the sensor network architecture with 2 base stations, and its corresponding communication protocol.},
