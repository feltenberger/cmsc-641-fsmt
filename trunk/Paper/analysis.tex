\section{Analysis}
The section compares our approach the 3-approximation algorithm for minimal power consumption of WSNs.
\section{Theoretical Analysis}

Our approach will be compared to the 3-approximations time and space usages from a theoretical standpoint.

\section{Experimental Analysis}
The theoretical analysis will be verified by an experimental analysis.
